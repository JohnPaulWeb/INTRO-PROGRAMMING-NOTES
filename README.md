HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as the
computer’s hardware. The programs that run on a computer are referred
to as software.

Hardware
The term hardware refers to all of the physical devices, or components, that a computer is made
of. A computer is not one single device, but a system of devices that all work together. Like the
different instruments in a symphony orchestra, each device in a computer plays its own part.

If you have ever shopped for a computer, you’ve probably seen sales literature listing com-
ponents such as microprocessors, memory, disk drives, video displays, graphics cards, and

so on. Unless you already know a lot about computers, or at least have a friend that does,
understanding what these different components do might be challenging. As shown in
Figure 1-2, a typical computer system consists of the following major components:
• The central processing unit (CPU)
• Main memory
• Secondary storage devices
• Input devices
• Output devices


THE INTRODUCTION OF CPU 

When a computer is performing the tasks that a program tells it to do, we say that the com-
puter is running or executing the program. The central processing unit, or CPU, is the part

of a computer that actually runs programs. The CPU is the most important component in
a computer because without it, the computer could not run software.
In the earliest computers, CPUs were huge devices made of electrical and mechanical
components such as vacuum tubes and switches. Figure 1-3 shows such a device.
The two women in the photo are working with the historic ENIAC computer. The
ENIAC, which is considered by many to be the world’s first programmable electronic
computer, was built in 1945 to calculate artillery ballistic tables for the U.S. Army. This
machine, which was primarily one big CPU, was 8 feet tall, 100 feet long, and weighed
30 tons.
Today, CPUs are small chips known as microprocessors. Figure 1-4 shows a photo of a lab
technician holding a modern microprocessor. In addition to being much smaller than the
old electromechanical CPUs in early computers, microprocessors are also much more
powerful.
